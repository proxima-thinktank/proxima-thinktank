# _The Writ of Proxim_

Myriad Obstacles lie upon the Way of digital&#8288;␣&#8288;Liberation. Fret not--but heark!--for the Way is about You!

Be disentangled from Inter's&#8288;␣&#8288;Net and stand present in the void&#8288;␣&#8288;Abode--this is Proxim's&#8288;␣&#8288;Mark.

## Useful HTML Escapes for Writing

> U+00A0 **No-Break Space** `&nbsp;` represented similarly to a space character, it prevents an automatic line break.
> U+2007 **Figure Space** `&#8199;` a space somewhat equal to the figures (0–9) characters.
> U+202F **Narrow No-Break Space** `&#8239;` or `&nnbsp;`) used to separate a suffix from a word stem without indicating a word boundary. Approximately 1/3 the representative space of a normal space though it may vary by font.
> U+2060 **Word-Joiner** `&#8288;` representative by no visible character, it prohibits a line break at its position.
